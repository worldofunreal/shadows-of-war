## 1. Architecture Overview

Dough is a **monolithic, fixed-path, semi-modular synth** remote-controlled via key/value messages.
Every sound is a "voice" that flows through an identical signal chain:

```
Oscillator → Gain Envelope → Filter → Per-voice FX → Pan → [Delay Send] → [Reverb Send] → Mix
                                                       ↑
                                           FM / AM / RM / Vibrato
```

Key design principles:
- **Single signal path per voice** — no routing graph, no patch cables
- **Parameter-driven** — every aspect controllable via flat key/value pairs
- **Envelopes attach to many targets** — filters, pitch, FM, not just gain
- **Voice allocation is automatic** — unless you pin a voice with `/voice/N`
- **Stateless messages** — each message carries its full intent, no prior state required

## 2. Signal Chain (per voice)

### 2.1 Oscillators

| Sound   | Description                                    | Param |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `sine`  | Pure sine wave                                 | `/sound/sine` |
| `tri`   | Triangle wave (default)                       | `/sound/tri` |
| `saw`   | Sawtooth (ramp up)                             | `/sound/saw` |
| `zaw`   | Reverse sawtooth (ramp down)                   | `/sound/zaw` |
| `pulse` | Pulse/square with variable width               | `/sound/pulse` + `/pw/0.3` |
| `pulze` | Antialiased pulse (band-limited)               | `/sound/pulze` |
| `white` | White noise                                    | `/sound/white` |
| `pink`  | Pink noise (1/f)                                | `/sound/pink` |
| `brown` | Brown noise (1/f²)                              | `/sound/brown` |
| `const` | Always 1.0 (useful for testing envelopes)       | `/sound/const` |
| samples | Sample playback via `s/` prefix                 | `/s/crate_bd` |

Default: `tri`

**Frequency control:**
- `/freq/440` — direct Hz (wins over note if both set)
- `/note/60` — MIDI note number (60 = middle C)
- `/speed/1.0` — multiplier on source freq / playback speed

**Pitch modulation:**
- `/vib/8` — vibrato LFO rate in Hz
- `/vibmod/2` — vibrato depth in semitones
- `/penv/24` — pitch envelope amount (semitones)
- `/patt/0.2` — pitch envelope attack time
- `/pdec/0.2` — pitch envelope decay time

**Pulse width:**
- `/pw/0.5` — 0 to 1, default 0.5 (square). Only affects `pulse` and `pulze`.

### 2.2 Gain Envelope (ADSR)

```
attack → decay → sustain → release
```

| Param      | Default | Description                   |
|------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| `/attack`  | 0.001   | Attack time in seconds        |
| `/decay`   | 0       | Decay time in seconds         |
| `/sustain`  | 1.0    | Sustain level (0–1)           |
| `/release`  | 0.001  | Release time in seconds       |
| `/gain`     | 0.5    | Pre-FX gain                   |
| `/postgain` | 1.0    | Post-FX gain                  |
| `/velocity` | 1.0    | Multiplies with gain          |

**Duration / gating:**
- `/duration/0.5` — gate duration in seconds. If not set, voice plays until released.
- `/time/0` — start time offset (seconds from now)
- `/repeat/8` — repeat the command within N seconds

### 2.3 FM Synthesis

Dough implements **2-operator FM**: carrier + modulator.

```
carrier_freq = freq (or note→freq)
modulator_freq = freq * fmh
modulation_index = fm * fm_env(t)
output = carrier(modulator(t) * fm_index)
```

| Param   | Default | Description                                |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `/fm`   | 0       | FM index (modulation depth)                |
| `/fmh`  | 1.0     | Harmonic ratio (mod_freq = freq × fmh)     |
| `/fme`  | 1.0     | FM envelope amount                         |
| `/fma`  | 0       | FM envelope attack (seconds)               |
| `/fmd`  | 0       | FM envelope decay (seconds)                |
| `/fms`  | 1.0     | FM envelope sustain (0–1)                  |
| `/fmr`  | 0       | FM envelope release (seconds)              |

**Key insight for game music:** `fmh` close to simple ratios (1, 2, 1.5, etc.) sounds harmonic.
Slightly detuned ratios (1.001, 2.01) create beating/drift — perfect for tension.

### 2.4 AM / RM (Amplitude & Ring Modulation)

| Param       | Default | Description                     |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `/am`       | 0       | AM frequency in Hz              |
| `/amdepth`  | 0.5     | AM depth (0–1)                  |
| `/rm`       | 0       | Ring mod frequency in Hz        |
| `/rmdepth`  | 0.5     | Ring mod depth (0–1, 1=full RM) |

**Game music use:** AM creates tremolo (slow) or metallic tones (fast).
RM creates inharmonic bell/metal textures.

### 2.5 Filters (LP / HP / BP)

Each filter type has a full ADSR envelope on its cutoff frequency.

**Low Pass Filter:**

| Param  | Default    | Description                        |
|--------|------------|------------------------------------|
| `/lpf` | 20000      | Cutoff frequency (Hz)              |
| `/lpq` | 1.0        | Resonance (0–16)                   |
| `/lpe` | 0          | Envelope amount                    |
| `/lpa` | 1.0        | Envelope attack (seconds)          |
| `/lpd` | 1.0        | Envelope decay (seconds)           |
| `/lps` | 1.0        | Envelope sustain (0–1)             |
| `/lpr` | 1.0        | Envelope release (seconds)         |

**High Pass Filter:** Same pattern with `hp*` prefix.

| Param  | Default |
|--------|---------|
| `/hpf` | 100     |
| `/hpq` | 0       |

**Band Pass Filter:** Same pattern with `bp*` prefix.

| Param  | Default |
|--------|---------|
| `/bpf` | 1       |
| `/bpq` | 1       |

**Filter slope:**

| `/ftype` | Value    | Description          |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| `0`      | `12db`   | 12 dB/oct (2-pole)   |
| `1`      | `24db`   | 24 dB/oct (4-pole)   |
| `2`      | `48db`   | 48 dB/oct (8-pole)   |

**Envelope behavior (same for lp/hp/bp):**
- Set only `lpa` (no `lpd`) → sustain = 1 (opens up)
- Set only `lpd` (no `lpa`) → sustain = 0 (closes down)
- Set both `lpa` + `lpd` → sustain = 0 (closes down)
- Set `lps` explicitly → overrides default

**Example: Filter sweep on combat intensity**
```
/lpf/200/lpe/5/lpd/0.6     → filter opens then decays
/lpf/200/lpe/5/lpa/0.3     → filter swells in from below
/lpf/200/lpe/5/lpa/0.2/lpd/0.4  → opens then closes
```

### 2.6 Per-voice FX

| Param          | Default | Description                         |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `/coarse`      | 1       | Sample rate divider (aliasing FX)    |
| `/crush`       | 32      | Bit crusher (bits, lower = more)     |
| `/distort`     | 0       | Waveshaping distortion (0–10+)       |
| `/distortvol`  | 1.0     | Post-distortion gain                 |

**Game music use:**
- `coarse/4` → lo-fi/retro textures (great for 8-bit aesthetic)
- `crush/4` → crunchy, degraded quality
- `distort/3` → warm overdrive (good for bass)
- `distort/8` → aggressive (combat music)

### 2.7 Stereo / Panning

| Param  | Default | Description                     |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `/pan` | 1.0     | 0=left, 0.5=center, 1=right    |

Note: dough's pan is mono→stereo. SoW SFX already does spatial panning better.
For music, we want stereo width/spread, not spatial positioning.

## 3. Global FX Sends

These are **shared across all voices** (not per-voice):

### 3.1 Delay

| Param             | Default | Description                    |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `/delay`          | 0.5     | Send level (0–1)               |
| `/delayfeedback`  | 0.5     | Feedback (0–0.999)             |
| `/delaytime`      | 0.12    | Delay time in seconds          |

**Game music use:** Dotted-eighth delays, slapback, feedback washes.

### 3.2 Reverb

| Param            | Default | Description                        |
|------------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `/verb`          | 0.5     | Send level (0–1)                   |
| `/verbdecay`     | 1.0     | Tail length (0–1)                  |
| `/verbdamp`      | 1.0     | HF damping (0–1, lower = darker)  |
| `/verbpredelay`  | 1.0     | Pre-delay (0–1)                    |
| `/verbdiff`      | 1.0     | Diffusion / early reflection density|

---

## 4. Voice Management

| Param    | Description                                          |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `/voice/N` | Pin to voice index N (skip auto-allocation)        |
| `/reset/1` | Reset voice even if active (retrigger envelopes)   |
| `/glide/0.5` | Pitch slide time when freq changes on active voice |

**Game music use:** Pin bass to voice 0, lead to voice 1, pads to voice 2, etc.
This lets the game update active voices in real-time without cutting them off.
`glide` creates portamento — essential for smooth melodic movement.

**Voice groups** (from keyboard example): `group` field lets you release by group.
Equivalent to "note off" for a specific held key.

## 6. Envelope System Design

Dough has **5 independent envelope targets**, each with full ADSR:

| Target     | Env Amount | Attack | Decay | Sustain | Release |
|------------|------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Gain       | N/A        | attack | decay | sustain | release |
| Low Pass   | lpe        | lpa    | lpd   | lps     | lpr     |
| High Pass  | hpe        | hpa    | hpd   | hps     | hpr     |
| Band Pass  | bpe        | bpa    | bpd   | bps     | bpr     |
| FM Index   | fme        | fma    | fmd   | fms     | fmr     |
| Pitch      | penv       | patt   | pdec  | (N/A)   | (N/A)   |

**How envelope amount works:**

For filter envelopes, `lpe` scales the cutoff:
```
effective_cutoff = lpf + lpe * lpf * envelope_value
```
When `lpe=5` and `lpf=200`:
- At envelope peak: cutoff = 200 + 5×200 = 1200 Hz (opens way up)
- At envelope sustain=0: cutoff returns to 200 Hz (base value)

For FM envelope, `fme` scales the FM index:
```
effective_fm = fm * fme * envelope_value
```

**Smart sustain defaults:**
- If only attack set → sustain = 1 (envelope opens up, stays open)
- If only decay set → sustain = 0 (envelope decays to zero)
- If both set → sustain = 0 (closes down)
- Explicit sustain overrides

**Game music implication:** Any parameter can have its own temporal shape.
Combat → filter opens fast then decays.
Ambient → filter slowly swells in.
Nuke → pitch envelope swoops up 24 semitones.

## 7. FX Chain Detail

### 7.1 Phaser
LFO sweeps notch filters across the spectrum.
- Slow rate (0.5 Hz) → sweeping, spacious
- Fast rate (4 Hz) → warbly, underwater
- `phasersweep` controls how wide the sweep is in Hz
- `phasercenter` is the midpoint frequency

### 7.2 Flanger
Short delay modulated by LFO creates comb filtering.
- Creates whooshy, metallic sweeps
- `flangerfeedback` controls resonance (0.7–0.9 = metallic, <0.3 = subtle)

### 7.3 Chorus
Slightly detuned copies create thickness/width.
- Slow rate (0.05–0.3 Hz) → lush pads
- `chorusdelay` in ms controls base delay (20ms = standard, 30ms = wider)

### 7.4 Delay
Simple feedback delay line.
- `delaytime/0.12` → ~120ms slapback
- `delaytime/0.375` → dotted eighth at ~120 BPM
- `delayfeedback/0.8` → long trailing washes

### 7.5 Reverb
Freeverb-style algorithmic reverb (Schroeder).
- `verbdecay` 0–1 → short room to infinite wash
- `verbdamp` → low = dark/muffled, high = bright
- `verbdiff` → high = dense/smooth, low = sparse/grainy

## 8. Math Primitives (from dough.c bakery articles)

Dough implements its own approximations for `sin`, `exp2`, `log2` — no stdlib math needed.
This enables barebones/nostdlib builds and WASM with minimal deps.

### 8.1 sin(x) — Parabolic → Rational Padé

**Fast version** (parabolic sine, max error ~0.056):
```c
// Wrap x into [-pi, pi]
x += PI; x *= (0.5/PI); x -= floor(x); x *= (2*PI); x -= PI;
return 0.40528473456935094 * x * (PI - fabs(x));
```

**Accurate version** (rational Padé, max error ~1e-7):
```c
// Triangle wave input for symmetry
x = (4*fabs(x*(0.5/PI) - floor(x*(0.5/PI) + 0.75) + 0.25) - 1) * (PI/2);
const float c2 = 445.0/12122.0, c3 = -2363.0/18183.0;
const float c4 = 601.0/872784.0, c5 = 12671.0/4363920.0;
const float c6 = 121.0/16662240.0;
float xx = x*x;
return x*(1 + xx*(c3 + xx*c5)) / (1 + xx*(c2 + xx*(c4 + xx*c6)));
```

### 8.2 exp2(x) — Float bit hack + polynomial

```c
// Scale x into large integer, reinterpret as float exponent
float result = u32_to_f32((int)(x + 127) << 23);
// Correction: multiply by polynomial for fractional part
```

### 8.3 log2(x) — Float bit hack + Padé

```c
// Extract exponent bits → stairstep log2
int stairstep = (f32_to_u32(x) >> 23) - 127;
// Compress mantissa into [1, 2] range
float xc = u32_to_f32((f32_to_u32(x) & 0x7FFFFF) | (127 << 23));
// Padé approximant for log2 on [1, 2]:
float f0 = xc;
return stairstep - 124.22544637 - 1.498030302*f0 - 1.72587999/(0.3520887068 + f0);
```

### 8.4 pow(a, b) = exp2(b * log2(a))

For constant base (like `pow(10, y)`):
```c
// pow(10, y) = exp2(y * 3.321928094887362)
```
This gives **6× speedup** vs. calling `pow()`.

**Key takeaway for SoW:** We can do all audio math without libm.
`libm = "0.2"` is already in our workspace deps, but the bit-hack approach
means we could compile a nostdlib WASM audio engine with zero deps.

---

## 9. Pattern / Sequencing Model

Dough itself does NOT have a built-in sequencer. It's triggered by external messages.
Strudel (the live-coding language) generates timed events that dough plays.

**Pattern mechanism (from strudel example):**
1. Strudel queries a time range `[a, b]` against a pattern
2. Pattern returns "hap" objects with onset times + durations
3. Each hap becomes a dough `play` message with timing

**For SoW game music, we need our own pattern engine:**
- Euclidean rhythms for percussion
- Arpeggiator patterns for melodic content
- Chord sequencing (I–V–vi–IV type progressions)
- Periodic triggers at BPM-synced intervals

**What dough gives us for free:**
- `/time/T` — schedule a voice T seconds from now
- `/repeat/N` — repeat the event every N seconds
- `/duration/D` — how long the note holds

So the game just needs to emit timed messages like:
```rust
music.send(Play { time: 0.0, note: 36, duration: 0.5, sound: Saw, repeat: 2.0, .. });
music.send(Play { time: 0.5, note: 48, duration: 0.25, sound: Pulse, repeat: 2.0, .. });
```
And dough handles the voice allocation, synthesis, and mixing.

## 10. SoW Current Audio vs Dough — Feature Gap

### What sow-audio already has:
- ✅ Warm harmonic oscillator (sine + 2nd + 3rd harmonics)
- ✅ ADSR-like envelopes (attack, decay, tail fade)
- ✅ Pitch bends / frequency sweeps
- ✅ Vibrato (in WarHorn source)
- ✅ Multi-voice mixing (3 voices, priority system)
- ✅ Spatial stereo panning + distance attenuation
- ✅ Volume ducking per voice count
- ✅ Pentatonic scale system + per-tile melodic context
- ✅ Simple arpeggiator (ArpeggioSource)
- ✅ Pulse / sweep / noise sources for SFX
- ✅ Sample-rate: 22050 Hz (low, mobile-friendly)
- ✅ CPAL output callback with a shared native/Web Audio mixer

### What sow-audio is MISSING for live music:

| Feature                    | Priority | Notes                                    |
|----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Filters (LP/HP/BP)**    | Critical | No filters at all. dough has 3 with ADSR |
| **FM synthesis**           | Critical | Only additive harmonics. FM = richness   |
| **Filter envelopes**       | Critical | Central to dough's sound-shaping         |
| **Waveform selection**     | High     | Only warm_at(). Need saw, tri, pulse, sq |
| **Per-voice FX**          | High     | No crush, distort, coarse               |
| **Global reverb**          | High     | No reverb at all. Essential for music    |
| **Global delay**           | High     | No delay. Core musical effect           |
| **Chorus/Flanger/Phaser**  | Medium   | Adds depth, motion, space               |
| **AM/RM**                  | Medium   | Metallic/bell textures                   |
| **Voice pinning + glide**  | High     | No way to hold a voice and morph it      |
| **Parameter smoothing**   | High     | No interpolation (clicks on changes)     |
| **Pattern/sequencer**      | High     | Only ArpeggioSource (4 notes, no rhythm) |
| **Music Director**         | High     | No game-state→music mapping at all       |
| **WASM audio output**     | Done     | CPAL uses the browser's Web Audio backend |

### What sow-audio has that dough DOESN'T:
- ✅ Spatial 3D panning + distance attenuation
- ✅ Priority-based voice stealing
- ✅ Game-event-driven triggering (combat, building, nuke, death)
- ✅ Per-tile melodic context (pentatonic scale from map position)
- ✅ Troops→amplitude mapping
- ✅ Rate limiting (combat + bunker sound spam prevention)

## 11. Game Music Architecture Proposal

### 11.1 Music Director Pattern

```
Game State → Music Director → Parameter Messages → Synth Voices → Audio Output
```

The Music Director watches game state and translates it into synth parameters:

| Game State              | Music Parameter                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Turn number             | Chord progression step          |
| Turn phase (build/fight)| Timbre: warm→harsh (filter, FM)|
| Active combats          | Filter cutoff, distortion gain  |
| Territory count         | Bass note root                  |
| Player ranking          | Tempo (BPM)                     |
| Nuke in flight          | Pitch envelope, reverb wash     |
| Victory/defeat imminent | Harmony mode (major→minor)      |
| Zoom level              | Mix: ambient→intimate           |

### 11.2 Stem-based Voice Layout

| Voice Index | Role        | Sound    | Typical Params                  |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| 0           | Sub bass    | sine     | note 24–36, fm 0.5, lpf 200    |
| 1           | Bass        | saw      | note 36–48, lpf 400, lpd 0.3   |
| 2           | Pad/Chords  | tri      | note 48–72, verb 0.8, chorus   |
| 3           | Lead        | pulse    | note 60–84, vib 4, delay 0.5  |
| 4           | Perc BD     | sample   | crate_bd, distort 1            |
| 5           | Perc SD     | sample   | crate_sd, hpf 200              |
| 6           | Perc HH     | sample   | crate_hh, gain 0.3             |
| 7           | FX/Noise    | pink     | hpf 2000, verb 0.9             |

### 11.3 Pattern Engine

```rust
struct Pattern {
    bpm: f32,
    step: u32,           // current 16th note
    bars: Vec<Bar>,      // sequence of bars
    tick_interval: Duration,
}
```

Each tick, the pattern engine evaluates which voices to trigger/update.
Not a full language like Strudel — just a programmatic sequencer.

### 11.4 WASM Strategy

The audio output must work in both native and WASM builds. The current
implementation uses CPAL's native backend and its Web Audio backend for WASM.
The mixer renders the existing Rust sources into CPAL's output callback. On the
browser target CPAL maps that callback to `AudioContext`, so no separate JS
audio engine, worklet, or target-specific no-op path is needed.

---

## 12. Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Synthesis (can prototype in 1–2 days)
1. `Oscillator` enum: sine, saw, zaw, tri, pulse, white, pink, brown
2. `Filter` struct: 2-pole SVF with LP/HP/BP outputs, resonance
3. `Envelope` struct: generic ADSR with amount scaling
4. `Voice` struct: osc → gain_env → filter(fil_env) → output
5. `Mixer` struct: mix N voices, global delay + reverb sends

### Phase 2: Modulation (1–2 days)
1. FM: modulator osc → carrier frequency
2. AM/RM: LFO on amplitude
3. Vibrato: LFO on pitch
4. Pitch envelope
5. Per-voice FX: crush, distort, coarse

### Phase 3: Voice Management (1 day)
1. Voice pinning (assign by index)
2. Glide / portamento
3. Parameter smoothing (1-sample lag for filter cutoff, gain)
4. Voice steal on overflow

### Phase 4: FX (1–2 days)
1. Delay line with feedback
2. Freeverb (Schroeder reverb)
3. Chorus (delay + LFO)
4. Phaser / Flanger (if time)

### Phase 5: Pattern Engine (2–3 days)
1. Step sequencer at configurable BPM
2. Euclidean rhythm generator
3. Chord/arpeggio patterns
4. Schedule with time offset

### Phase 6: Game Integration (2–3 days)
1. Music Director: game state → param updates
2. Stem definitions per game phase
3. Crossfade between musical states
4. Hook into `SowApp::update()`

### Phase 7: WASM Output (2–3 days)
1. `web-sys` AudioContext construction
2. ScriptProcessorNode or AudioWorklet for sample output
3. Shared ring buffer between Rust (WASM) and Web Audio
4. COOP/COEP headers (or use AudioWorklet which avoids SharedArrayBuffer requirement)

## 13. Key dough.c Code Patterns to Study

From the source (single C file), the key patterns are:

1. **Voice struct as flat state** — all params stored as floats, no graph
2. **Message = struct of optional params** — parse once, apply to voice
3. **Sample-accurate timing** — messages carry `time` field, queued ahead
4. **Stateless rendering** — each sample computed from voice state, no lookahead
5. **Filter = SVF (state variable filter)** — single struct gives LP/HP/BP simultaneously
6. **Reverb = Freeverb** — 4 parallel comb + 4 series allpass
7. **Delay = simple circular buffer** — read head at (write - delay_samples)

## 14. dough.c Source Code Breakdown

This section details the actual implementation patterns found in `dough.c`, highlighting areas where the C code diverges from initial assumptions and providing a blueprint for the Rust port.

### 14.1 Memory Layout
Dough avoids dynamic allocation during playback. In `dough_engine_init`, it allocates a single massive block of memory using a custom `malloc` (or system `malloc` for native):
```c
engine->memory = malloc(vs + os + ds + vbs + es + fs + fb);
```
The memory is strictly partitioned:
1. `vs`: Array of `voice` structs (Voice state)
2. `os`: Array of `Orbit` structs (Global delay/reverb states)
3. `ds`: Delay line buffers
4. `vbs`: Reverb buffers (Dattorro delay lines)
5. `es`: Scheduler events array
6. `fs`: PCM sample data
7. `fb`: Framebuffer for visualization

**Rust Translation:** We can achieve this without unsafe pointers by storing these as `Vec<T>` or pre-allocated `Box<[f32]>` in an `Engine` or `Mixer` struct that lives for the lifetime of the application.

### 14.2 The Voice Struct (Flat State)
A `voice` contains no graph or pointers. It is a completely flat state machine:
```c
typedef struct {
  // Envelopes
  ADSRNode gain_adsr, lp_adsr, hp_adsr, bp_adsr, fm_adsr, p_adsr;
  // Oscillators/LFOs
  Phasor phasor, vib_lfo, fm_modulator, am_lfo, rm_lfo;
  // Filters (Biquad arrays for multi-pole)
  BiquadFilter lp_bq[4], hp_bq[4], bp_bq[4];
  // FX
  Phaser phaser; Flanger flanger; Chorus chorus;
  // Params
  Event p; // The parsed message that triggered this voice
  float ch[CHANNELS]; // Output buffer
  // ...
} voice;
```
**Rust Translation:** A massive `Voice` struct containing all sub-components. We process them sequentially in a fixed order. If an effect isn't active (checked via `v.p.lp_active`), it's simply skipped.

### 14.3 Rendering Loop Flow
The engine renders sample by sample, not block by block.
1. `dsp()` loops over `BLOCK_SIZE` (128).
2. For each sample index `i`, it calls `schedule_update()` to process any events due at the current `doughtime`.
3. It calls `gen_sample(engine, output, i)`.
4. `gen_sample` loops over all active voices.
5. `run_voice()` computes the source, applies LFOs, computes envelopes, runs channel-wise FX (filters, crush, distort, chorus), and accumulates into `voice->ch`.
6. Voice channels are added to the mix and multiplied by send amounts for delay/reverb.
7. Delay and Reverb are processed globally per "Orbit" and added to the mix.

### 14.4 Filter Implementation (Biquad vs SVF)
Contrary to initial assumptions, Dough uses two distinct filter implementations:
1. **Audio Path (BiquadFilter):** The actual lowpass/highpass/bandpass filters applied to the audio use the **Audio EQ Cookbook Biquad** formulas. To achieve steeper slopes (12dB, 24dB, 48dB), it cascades 1, 2, or 4 biquad stages in series.
2. **Modulation Path (Filter):** A simple 2-pole State Variable Filter (SVF) is implemented but appears to be used primarily for smoothing or internal modulation, not the main audio path.

### 14.5 Reverb Algorithm (Jon Dattorro)
Dough does NOT use Freeverb. It implements the **Jon Dattorro Reverb**, a much higher quality algorithm based on a complex feedback delay network.
* **Pre-delay & Pre-filter:** Lowpass filter on the input.
* **Input Diffusion:** 4 cascading all-pass filters.
* **Reverb Tank (Figure-8):** Two symmetrical tanks cross-coupled. Each tank has an allpass, delay, lowpass (damping), and another allpass.
* **Taps:** The stereo output is created by tapping the delay lines at 7 specific prime-number offsets (4 for Left, 3 for Right).

**Rust Translation:** We should port this exact `DattorroVerb` struct and its hardcoded prime-number buffer sizes.

### 14.6 Message Parsing & "Event" State
Messages arrive as key/value pairs (`/freq/440/lpf/2000`).
* They are parsed into an `Event` struct where every field defaults to `NAN`.
* `nan_fallback()` replaces un-set fields with sensible defaults (e.g., if `/sound` is set but not `/pw`, `pw` becomes 0.5).
* Missing sustain values are intelligently inferred: if only `attack` is provided, `sustain` defaults to 1.0; if `decay` is provided, `sustain` defaults to 0.0.

### 14.7 Math Primitives without libm
To compile for WASM without a standard library (`#ifdef CLANGWASM`), Dough implements its own math:
* `our_sinf`: Rational Padé approximant (highly accurate without Taylor series branching).
* `our_exp2f` & `our_log2f`: Brilliant float-bit-hacks manipulating the IEEE-754 exponent bits directly, combined with polynomials for the mantissa.
* `our_powf`: Implemented as `exp2(y * log2(x))`.

**Rust Translation:** While Rust's `core` doesn't have math, `libm` does. However, if we want extreme WASM binary size optimization, porting these bit-hacks would eliminate the `libm` dependency entirely.


## 15. Audit: sow-audio vs. dough architecture

Here is where `sow-audio` currently stands compared to the `dough` blueprint:

### 1. Audio Output Threading
*   **dough:** Native uses PortAudio with a single callback. WASM uses a shared memory block; JS calls `js_init` and reads the float buffer directly via `requestAnimationFrame` or `AudioWorklet`.
*   **sow-audio:** Uses one Rust mixer backed by CPAL. Native output uses the
    platform audio device; WASM output uses CPAL's Web Audio backend. The CPAL
    callback pulls frames from the same mixer on both targets.

### 2. Audio Processing (Sources vs Mixer)
*   **dough:** One monolithic `Mixer` that loops over `active_voices`, rendering sample-by-sample (`gen_sample`).
*   **sow-audio:** Defines sources as structs implementing `Iterator<Item = f32>`
    and the small local `AudioSource` trait (e.g., `DoublePulseSource`,
    `ArpeggioSource`). The local mixer resamples and mixes them into CPAL's
    output callback.

### 3. State Management & Commands
*   **dough:** `Event` struct holds 50+ parameters. Messages mutate the parameters of a `voice` struct.
*   **sow-audio:** Commands like `AudioCommand::PlayCombatSound` carry simple
    enums, which the engine turns into source objects and pushes to the local
    mixer. The priority system tracks the number of active voices.

**Next step:** The command enums already provide the game integration boundary. A future music engine can add a synth-event command without changing the output backend.

### 4. Math Dependencies
*   **dough:** Implements `our_sinf`, `our_exp2f` to avoid C `math.h` and shrink WASM size.
*   **sow-audio:** Uses `std::f32::consts` and standard `.sin()` methods.

**Migration Path:** Since Rust's `core` doesn't include trig functions, compiling `sow-audio` for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` without `std` (or without `libm`) would fail. We can either just use `std` (since WASM size isn't a critical bottleneck for us yet, and web-sys brings in a lot anyway) or port Dough's bit-hack math functions if we want an ultra-minimal core. For now, we will stick to `std::f32::sin()` for simplicity.
