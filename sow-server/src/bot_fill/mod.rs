//! Fictional humans — internal bot fill for Matchmaking lobbies.
//!
//! ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//! MENTAL MODEL — read this before touching ANYTHING in this module.
//! ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//! These are FICTIONAL HUMANS. Not PvE bots, not a daemon, not "the
//! backfill". They are human players that don't exist, and they must look
//! like it.
//!
//! THE ONE RULE: organic. Nothing here may ever be predictable, regular,
//! or metronomic. A lobby must never fill at a fixed rate. Two lobbies
//! must never fill alike. Nobody — player or agent — may ever be able to
//! guess how many ghosts there are, or when the next one joins.
//!
//! What "organic" looks like in practice:
//!   - each ghost INDEPENDENTLY picks a random moment somewhere across the
//!     whole countdown window (second 0 to the last second). No mean, no
//!     drip, no "next after this one"
//!   - bursts (several ghosts landing on the same moment) are normal —
//!     that's what independent placement produces
//!   - silences (nobody for several seconds) are normal — same reason
//!   - a lobby can fill in the first 2s, in the last 2s, spread out, or
//!     never get past half. Nobody can guess the rhythm because there IS none
//!   - the fill percentage is random per lobby (min/max bounds only)
//!   - there is NO perceptible rate. If a human watching can tap a tempo,
//!     it's broken
//!
//! REGRESSION WARNINGS (for future agents):
//!   - reintroducing a per-lobby mean, a drip cooldown, an inter-arrival
//!     distribution with a central tendency, or ANY sequential "next entry
//!     depends on the previous" structure = REGRESSION. That recreates the
//!     perceptible heartbeat this module exists to kill
//!   - adding a fixed interval, constant pace, linear ramp, deterministic
//!     schedule, or "smoother" distribution = REGRESSION, not a fix
//!   - "fixing" randomness that looks random = REGRESSION
//!   - "helping" by making entry consistent = REGRESSION
//!   - replacing randomness with anything an observer could predict =
//!     REGRESSION.
//!
//! Identities come exclusively from the persistent bot-account pool seeded
//! at boot (`BotPool`) — real `database_account_id`s, stats accumulation,
//! display names reused from `names::BOT_NAMES`. If the pool is
//! unavailable, nothing is injected (no anonymous fallback names).

// ── Independent-moment placement ──────────────────────────────────────────

/// Per-tick injection of fictional humans. Called from `promote_countdown`
/// every tick (10 Hz).
///
/// MENTAL MODEL (organic — read the module header before changing this):
///  1. First sighting of a lobby: roll a random fill percentage
///     (`SOW_BOT_FILL_MIN`..`SOW_BOT_FILL_MAX` of max_players). Every lobby
///     gets its own count — no two lobbies ever fill alike.
///  2. Each reserved ghost INDEPENDENTLY picks a random moment
///     (`join_at_elapsed`, uniform over the whole countdown window) to show
///     up. There is NO mean, NO drip clock, NO "next entry depends on the
///     previous one". Timing is a set of independent points on a line, not a
///     sequence. That is what kills any perceptible rate.
///  3. Leave room for external players: target is a TOTAL (external players
///     + bots). External players present → fewer bots needed → trim the pending queue. Already-met
///       ghosts stay; the lobby keeps the ghosts that were going to show up
///       soonest.
///  4. Each tick: every pending ghost whose `join_at_elapsed` has been
///     reached enters NOW. Several can land on the same tick (a burst); none
///     can land for many ticks (a silence). Both are correct and intended —
///     that is literally independent placement.
///  5. When the reserved batch runs out, the lobby stops filling. A lobby can
///     legitimately sit half-full forever. That is correct.
