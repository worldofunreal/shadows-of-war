# Agent Instructions

These instructions describe the current Shadows of War deployment. Historical
hostnames, paths and compatibility behavior are not production instructions.

## Core rules

- Execute exactly the requested scope; do not invent adjacent work.
- Verify before making claims. Distinguish current runtime facts from historical
  evidence and roadmap design.
- Before map or thumbnail work, read `docs/maps.md` for the reviewed framing,
  current generator limitations, and independent mobile terrain budgets.
- Infrastructure decisions, firewall/PF/NSG changes and new resources require
  explicit user approval.
- The deploy pipeline is the only deployment interface. Never activate a
  release, copy artifacts, restart services, or edit production configuration
  manually.
- If `./sow p` is intentionally run and fails in a pipeline step, fix the
  pipeline and rerun it. Do not bypass it. Do not invoke it merely to validate
  an unrelated platform-specific change.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.

## Current production topology

### IONOS game/orchestrator host

- SSH alias: `ionos`; public IP: `74.208.246.177`.
- FreeBSD 15.1-STABLE, 4 vCPU, approximately 8 GiB RAM.
- Release layout: `/srv/sow/current` → `releases/<sha>`; web assets at
  `/srv/sow/web`; state at `/var/db/sow/`; logs at `/var/log/sow/`.
- Loopback-only services: `sow-server` WebSocket `25564`, HTTP/admin/maps
  `25566`, `sow-database` `25585`, and Valkey `6379`.
- nginx terminates public HTTP/TLS on `:80`/`:443` and proxies the game
  orchestrator WebSocket to `127.0.0.1:25564`.
- `/admin/api/status` is localhost-only; `/health` is not a server route.

### Azure F-Stack relay host

- SSH alias: `relay`; VM: `sow-dev-2nic`; Linux with F-Stack/DPDK.
- Management IP: `20.230.49.9`; data/public IP: `20.122.128.185`.
- Four `sow-relay@0..3` workers, one per DPDK queue. Management HTTPS is on
  `8080..8083`; game listeners use dynamically allocated ports registered by
  `sow-server`.
- Clients receive `relay.shadowsofwar.io` and a dynamic game port, then connect
  directly with `wss://`; IONOS is not in the game-packet data path.
- `SOW_RELAY_WORKERS` is the authoritative catalog. Production requires relay
  management TLS and relay tickets (`SOW_RELAY_TICKETS_REQUIRED=1`).
- The old Azure FreeBSD host `sow`/`20.7.77.78` and aliases `azure` and
  `sow-prod` are stale and must not be used.

## Deploy pipeline (`./sow p`)

1. Run read-only preflight on the control host and FreeBSD builder.
2. Build WASM locally and FreeBSD binaries on the dedicated builder.
3. Assemble an immutable release with final component hashes.
4. Compare the release manifest with `/srv/sow/current/COMPONENTS`.
5. Stage only after the plan is known; activate with an atomic symlink swap.
6. Restart only the affected jail service and verify jail-aware health.
7. Retain the five newest releases and perform public verification.

When `plan.relay`, the pipeline restarts the affected relay workers last via
per-worker stop/start (`sow-dist/src/prod.rs:activate_relay_host`). The registered
drain mode is force-kill (user-authorized 2026-08-21; non-destructive drain
pending), which ends active games on restarted workers — a relay change must
never ship without that drain report in the manifest.
There is no production backfill subcommand. `./sow p` is the production
deployment path for web/backend (WASM + FreeBSD + Azure); `./sow l` / `./sow local` is a local-only web/WASM preview;
`./sow` without a subcommand runs the native client.
Android is decoupled on purpose: `./sow a` / `./sow android` builds the AAB
and publishes it to Google Play alpha. Every Play upload restarts Google's
review clock, so `./sow p` never touches Android. The owner alone runs `./sow a`
manually only when a new build is actually ready for review; Codex must never
run it or upload to Play. Codex validates Android locally with
`scripts/android-local-test.sh` only. This four-command interface
(`native`, `l`, `p`, `a`) is the amended CLI contract; do not invent
further subcommands.

### Legacy egui reopened

`sow-ui` is the native egui UI and is officially open for development again.
The desktop client may change `sow-ui/src/**/*.rs` on macOS, Linux, and Windows
when native performance or rapid visual validation requires it. The old
`sow-ui/LEGACY_UI.sha256` manifest is retained as historical reference only;
the freeze gate is disabled in all developer and iOS workflows.

## Platform-specific workflows

- iOS-only work on macOS uses `scripts/ios-testflight.sh`. Validate the iOS
  archive/export there and upload only when the user requests an upload.
- Do not run `./sow p` for iOS-only work on macOS. The Mac is not a production
  control host unless it has the complete production prerequisites configured,
  including the Linux-side tooling, FreeBSD builder/VM, SSH access, and
  required release credentials.
- Never create a FreeBSD VM, provision release keys, or configure production
  access implicitly. Those are infrastructure changes requiring explicit user
  approval.
- App Store Connect evidence must be stated precisely: `Upload succeeded` from
  `xcodebuild -exportArchive` proves only that Apple accepted the upload. It
  does not prove that the build is processed, available to testers, or in
  TestFlight.
- Treat an App Store Connect build marked `Missing Compliance` as blocked and
  unavailable for testing until export compliance is completed. `Ready to Test`
  or `Testing` is the evidence required before claiming TestFlight readiness.
- Apple has an App Store Connect API for app-encryption declarations, but it
  requires an authenticated JWT signed with an App Store Connect API key. Do
  not claim API automation unless the current environment has a working
  connector or verified credentials.
- Agent-Reach is an internet research/access layer for web and listed upstream
  channels; it is not an App Store Connect, TestFlight, Apple Developer, or
  Xcode connector. Use it to verify public documentation, never as evidence of
  private App Store Connect state.

## Production pipeline validation gate

- Changes intended for the production web/backend/FreeBSD release must be
  validated with `./sow p` from the configured production control host. The
  owner alone runs `./sow a` for Android/Google Play; Codex never runs it or
  uploads Android. Codex's Android validation is local-only through
  `scripts/android-local-test.sh`.
- `./sow l` / `./sow local` is for local web/WASM preview only. It does not
  validate production deployment and does not replace `./sow p` when that
  pipeline is in scope.
- The user has granted standing authorization for `./sow p` after a requested
  production change. Do not ask for a second deploy confirmation, and do not
  substitute manual infrastructure commands.
- Do not run `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test`, JavaScript syntax
  checks, or similar local substitutes as routine validation for a production
  pipeline change. Use them only to diagnose a specific failed `./sow p` step,
  then rerun `./sow p`; they never replace the pipeline.
- If an in-scope `./sow p` run fails or cannot complete its health/public
  verification, stop at the failure, report the exact output, and leave the
  production task unclaimed rather than declaring victory.

## Read-only debugging

The following commands are diagnostics only; production mutations belong in
the appropriate official pipeline (`./sow p` for web/backend/FreeBSD and
`./sow a` for Android/Play).

```sh
ssh ionos 'sudo service sow_server status'
ssh ionos 'sudo service sow_database status'
ssh ionos 'sudo tail -50 /var/log/sow/server.log'
ssh ionos 'sudo tail -50 /var/log/sow/database.log'
ssh ionos 'sudo sockstat -4l | grep -E "sow_|relay"'
ssh ionos 'ps aux | grep -E "sow_server|sow_database|relay"'
ssh ionos 'readlink /srv/sow/current'
ssh ionos 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:25566/admin/api/status'
ssh relay 'systemctl is-active sow-relay@0 sow-relay@1 sow-relay@2 sow-relay@3'
ssh relay 'systemctl show sow-relay@0 sow-relay@1 sow-relay@2 sow-relay@3 -p ActiveState -p Result -p ExecMainStatus'
```

For relay health use the authenticated HTTPS management endpoints; do not use
an unauthenticated HTTP `/internal/lobbies` request as a health probe.

## Identity and player-flow contract

- Anonymous players have one canonical account ID issued by
  `POST /profile/anonymous`, stored client-side as `sow_account_id`.
- The anonymous account also owns a persisted `display_name`; the client does
  not cache that name separately. Browser refresh reloads it by account ID;
  clearing site storage intentionally creates a new account.
  Renames use `POST /profile/anonymous/name` and never change the account ID.
  CrazyGames verified identities and persistent bot accounts use
  `LinkedIdentity` records and are separate provider cases.
- `Join.database_account_id` is client-declared roster/progress metadata. The
  server may use it to correlate a lobby reconnect or ban, but it is not proof
  of identity or relay authentication. The relay authenticates the direct game
  connection with a short-lived match ticket
  (`ReadyWithTicket`/`ReconnectWithTicket`).
- Anonymous `account_id` is a bearer-like progress lookup key, not a secret or
  platform credential; do not use it as an authorization decision.
- Unticketed relay frames remain only as wire-compatibility decoding; production
  refuses them when `SOW_RELAY_TICKETS_REQUIRED=1`.

## Audit guidance

### Android evidence gate

- `/home/bizkit/Github/shadows-of-war/docs/android-runtime-contract.md` is the
  authoritative Android startup, bridge, commerce, and evidence contract.
- Every Android claim must be labeled `SOURCE`, `DEVICE`, `PLAY_API`,
  `TRANSACTION`, or `HISTORICAL`, and must identify the artifact SHA, source
  SHA, package, versionCode, device, and timestamp when runtime is involved.
- Source order, a successful build, a Play catalog response, or an old log is
  not runtime or transaction proof. Use `scripts/android-local-test.sh` for
  the executable startup gate; it must fail on missing artifact identity or
  order violations.

### Investigation Protocol (Zero Trust)

- Audit code and live state before proposing a cause; theories are not evidence.
- Do not call a change fixed without runtime logs and a real execution path.
- Stop at the first failed gate; never bypass the reproducible pipeline.
- Prefer deletion and the smallest required diff over wrappers, cosmetic
  refactors, or micro-hardening that does not reduce the actual blast radius.

- Label historical reports and PRDs as historical/roadmap when their baseline
  differs from the running system.
- Do not remove active bot accounts, CrazyGames `LinkedIdentity`, canonical
  anonymous identity, or protocol compatibility solely because the names look
  similar; verify call sites first.
- Search for stale hosts, old relay routing, removed profile-link routes, and
  unauthenticated relay assumptions before changing code.

## Safety lessons

- A hardcoded PF IP previously caused total SSH loss. Never edit PF/NSG without
  explicit approval; validate syntax before loading rules and preserve SSH.
- On a new VM, verify `sudo id`/root access before any other operation.
- Every infrastructure mutation must be reproducible from this repository and
  the pipeline.
