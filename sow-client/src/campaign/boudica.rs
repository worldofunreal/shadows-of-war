//! Episode 1 — Boudica's Rebellion on the `boudica` map (896×504; x→east, y→south).
//!
//! The roster (who/where/role/iq + player spawn) lives in ONE place:
//! `assets/campaign/boudica.json`, authored visually with `tools/campaign-editor` (`./sow m`).
//! That file is the single source of truth — embedded here as the compiled-in default so web /
//! offline always has it, and overridden at runtime on native by the same file on disk (export →
//! relaunch, no recompile). Browser campaigns load the same JSON at runtime; this module only
//! preserves the native first-run route.

/// The committed roster, embedded so it ships in every build (incl. wasm, which can't read files).
/// Exactly the bytes the native fallback reads — one source, no divergence.
const DEFAULT_ROSTER: &str = include_str!("../../../assets/campaign/boudica.json");

/// Last-ditch spawn if even the embedded roster fails to parse (a test guards that it never does).
const FALLBACK_SPAWN: (u32, u32) = (720, 180);

/// The episode roster + player spawn the tutorial uses. Resolution order (one path, no confusion):
/// 1. native runtime override — `$SOW_CAMPAIGN_ROSTER` or `assets/campaign/boudica.json` on disk
///    (the editor loop: Export → relaunch, no recompile);
/// 2. the embedded committed default (same file, compiled in) — installed native builds;
/// 3. an empty roster at `FALLBACK_SPAWN` (only if the embedded JSON is somehow corrupt).
